# BUILD IT - Research First, Build Second

### What is Build IT?

**Build IT** is an intensive 5-day online event where teams dive deep into modern protocols, algorithms, and technical concepts. Unlike typical hackathons that focus only on the final product, Build IT emphasizes the "Research first, Build second" methodology.

Teams are challenged to understand a complex technical concept at a deep level, document it thoroughly, and implement it into a functional website or application.

### 📅 Event Timeline

- **Start Date:** December 23, 2025 at 20:00 (Kickoff Meeting)
- **Submission Deadline:** December 28, 2025 at 00:00
- **Duration:** 5 Days
- **Platform:** Online (Discord-based)

---

### 👥 Team Structure & Eligibility

- **Team Size:** 5 members per team.
- **Capacity:** Approximatively of 20 teams participating.
- **Assignment:** Themes are assigned randomly during the kickoff meeting.

---

### 🧠 The Challenge: Research, Document, Build

Each team will receive a specific technical **Theme** (a concept, algorithm, or protocol). The goal is not just to use the technology, but to master it.

#### 1. Research

Teams must understand their assigned protocol or algorithm at a deep technical level.

#### 2. Document (The README)

Instead of a separate PDF, the **README.md** serves as the primary technical paper. It must explain the concept in detail before explaining the specific app implementation.

#### 3. Build

Implement a real-world project (Website or App) that demonstrates the technology in action.

#### Theme Examples:

> - **Theme:** WebSockets
>   - **Output:** Build a real-time collaborative code editor or chat app.
> - **Theme:** LangChain
>   - **Output:** Build a website featuring autonomous AI Agents.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

To complete the challenge, teams must submit the following by the deadline:

#### 1. GitHub Repository

A complete repository containing the source code of the website or application.

#### 2. Comprehensive README.md

The README must be treated as a technical article and include:

- **Concept Deep-Dive:** A detailed explanation of the assigned algorithm/protocol (how it works theoretically).
- **Implementation Details:** How the concept was specifically applied in this project.
- **Architecture Diagrams:** Visuals of the system design.
- **Setup Instructions:** How to run the project locally.

#### 3. Presentation Video

A recorded video (Voice + Screen Recording) that:

- Explains how the concept/algorithm works technically.
- Showcases the final result (App/Website) in action.
- Demonstrates the features working.

### 🏆 Tournament Structure

#### Phase 1: The Build (Dec 23 - Dec 28)

- **Kickoff (Dec 23 @ 20h):** General meeting explaining the rules and random assignment of themes to teams.
- **Development:** Teams work asynchronously to research and build their solutions.
- **Submission (Dec 28 @ 00h):** All repositories and videos must be submitted.

#### Phase 2: The Finals (Selection)

- **Qualification:** Judges review submissions to select the **Top 10 teams** (based on quality).
- **Final Pitch:** Selected teams proceed to a live presentation (Onsite preferred, or Online).
  - Teams present to a panel of judges.
  - Judges ask technical questions to test the team's understanding of the algorithm.

#### Phase 3: Victory

- **Selection:** Judges select the Top 3 Teams.
- **Grand Prize:** Announcement of the **GLOBAL WINNER TEAM**.
